/*
To use two variables 'up' and 'down' to count the steps of continuous up and down respectively, and a 'peak' representing the peak before going down. In the below example:
[0, 1, 20, 9, 8, 7]
Scan from left to right, first child is given 1 candy;
the second child is given 2 candies, and up=1;
the third child is given 3 candies, and up=2; peak=2;
the fourth child is given 1 candy, and down=1; and third child still has 3 candies since peak=2;
the fifth child is given 1 candy, and down=2; and the previous child needs 1 more candy now but the third child no need more;
the sixth child is given 1 candy, and down=3; and both the fifth and fourth child needs 1 more candy now, and the peak, the third child need 1 more as well.
